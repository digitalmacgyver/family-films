**Date/Time:** 2025-01-03 01:10:00 (estimated)
**Elapsed:** 00:05:00
**Prompt:** "I'm going to build up a list of changes from local testing:

1) films without YouTube content are showing in the catalog
2) the animated thumbnails don't seem to be functioning on mouseover
3) the default number of films to display per page in the catalog should be 50, not 12
4) when I visit film detail links I get the following error: \"TemplateSyntaxError at /films/<>/
Invalid block tag on line 95: 'static', expected 'empty' or 'endfor'. Did you forget to register or load this tag?\""

### Prompt 20
**Date/Time:** 2025-01-03 01:15:00 (estimated)
**Elapsed:** 00:05:00
**Prompt:** "I have some more changes to make:

1) The animated thumbnails appear smaller than the static ones they are replacing, they should be the same size
2) Clicking on each of the chapter links in the film detail page should seek the YouTube video to the relevant timestamp
3) The +X more ui elements that appear when only a small number of items are displayed should should when moused over to show a popup describing the additional items. (e.g. +2 more should have a hover tooltip showing the 2 location names, people names, or tags that are hidden)
4) The default sort order for films should not be by title, it should be the order they appear in a YouTube playlist. Fetch the YouTube playlist that contains the films and extract a playlist order associated with each film. Make the UI for this say \"Playlist Order\" rather than \"Date Added\"
5) Create a separate sort ui where users can select to sort by options and for each option be able to reverse the sort order (for instance, sort by Year with the earliest year first or the latest year first). Hide the sort by Date Added option and add a new sort by Year option"

**Elapsed:** 00:05:00

**Date/Time:** 2025-01-03 01:25:00 (estimated)
**Elapsed:** 00:05:00
**Prompt:** "On the film detail page, for example http://127.0.0.1:8000/films/P-61_FROS/ the chapters listing that appears on the right should seek the video to the corresponding time - e.g. clicking on a chapter with heading \"04:05 - Christmas Presents\" should seek the video to playback at 4 minutes and 5 seconds e.g. 4*60+5=245 seconds into the film."

### Prompt 27
**Date/Time:** 2025-01-03 01:50:00 (estimated)
**Elapsed:** 00:05:00
**Prompt:** "1. So far this UI is read only. Add these features for editing film and chapter metadata:
  * on the Film detail page to allow for adding and removing the People, Locations, Years and tags for the Film
    + When adding a new item, the interface is a text box. As text is entered autocomplete options matching the text 
appear. If the user clicks on an autocomplete option it is added. If the user hits enter and their text is an exact m
atch for an existing item that item is selected. If the user hits enter and their text is not an exact match for an e
xisting item a new item is created with that text.
  * on the Film details page, allow for adding and removing per-chapter metadata for People, Locations, Years and tag
s with a similar UI to the overall film metedata. This UI element is loaded and pertains to the currently selected ch
apter, if any.
  * On the Film detail page, add an open text area to add free text notes for  chapter and/or edit the existing notes
 for that chapter. Include an aggregate read only list of all the notes for all the chapters below the film.

2. For the main Films page and search functions, a film is considered to have the union of all People, Locations, Yea
rs, and tags of the Film and all it's chapters. Example: If a film has chapter 1, and the Film has People: PersonA, P
ersonB; and chapter 1 has People: PersonA, PersonC; then the Film is considered to have: PersonA, PersonB, and Person
C, while chapter 1 is considered to have only PersonA and PersonC.

3. Revise the animated thumbnail generation to have one thumbnail for each chapter, drawn from the film as of the cha
pter start time. IF there are fewer than 4 chapters, add additional thumnails evenly spaced throughout the duration o
f the film so there are at leasst 4 thumbnails total.

4. On the Film detail page, add a small thumbnail chapter to each of the chapter navigation entries.

5. Only authenticated users can use any of the edit functionality that changes film or clip metadata. Use an existing
 authentication module, plugin, or library and configure it for these behaviors:
  * Users can not self register, the Django admin user will create all user accounts either explicitly or via an invi
tation mechanism
  * Invited users have access to a forgotten account name and password reset workflow.
  * Unauthenticated users can still see all the read only features of the site, and can authenticate by clicking a lo
g in button in the top header"

### Prompt 28
**Date/Time:** 2025-01-03 01:55:00 (estimated)
**Elapsed:** 00:05:00
**Prompt:** "Next do the chapter level metadata suite of features."

### Prompt 29
**Date/Time:** 2025-01-03 02:00:00 (estimated)
**Elapsed:** 00:05:00
**Prompt:** "On the film details page make these fixes to the chapters feature:

1. In the chapter list the click to begin playback at that time feature has stopped working.
2. Include a small static thumbnail image next to the chapter description that is from the video at that time.

These features should function whether or not the user is logged in."

### Prompt 30
**Date/Time:** 2025-01-03 02:05:00 (estimated)
**Elapsed:** 00:05:00
**Prompt:** "Feature fixes and updates:

* On the main films page clicking in the thumbnail region should take you to the film detail page for that film as if you'd clicked the Watch Film button.
* On the main films page clicking on a Person, Location, or Year should take you to the Search page for that item type with that item selected
* On the film details page the chapter list is showing as a nesting series of boxes, there is probably a closing tag that is missing. Make each chapter entry one row with the same left justification.
* On the film details page clicking a chapter item does not cause the youtube player to begin playing at that location. Previously this worked.
* On the film details page as an authenticated, clicking the Edit button next to People, Locations, or Tags has no effect. It should open an edit interface.
* On the Film details page as an authenticated user, clicking the \"x\" portion of People and Locations should remove those people from the video, but nothing changes when these x's are clicked. (Apply the same fix to the Tags region on the page)
* On the Film details page, move the read only \"All Chapter Notes\" UI element below the main video between the Description and Technical Notes.
* On the Film details page add a place where chapter notes for the currently selected chapter, if any, can be added/edited.
* On the Film details page add a way for authenticated users to edit the Years associated with the main video.

Create tests that verify the features for addition of a Person, Location, Years, Tag, and chapter descriptions, and the deletion of those function as expected."
